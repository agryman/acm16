A computer code for calculations in the algebraic collective model of
the atomic nucleus, by
T.A. Welsh and D.J. Rowe.  

This package comprises the following files (the 1.4 in some give
the version number):

  acm1.4.mpl
  acm1.4a-examples.mpl
  acm1.4a-examples.pdf
  acm1.4-user.mpl
  so5cg-data13.zip
  so5cg-data24.zip
  so5cg-data56.zip
  README1.4

Synopses:

  acm1.4.mpl - The Maple code.
    This, along with the CG data files, is all that is required to carry
    out ACM calculations. This file should not be edited by the user.

  acm1.4a-examples.mpl - A Maple worksheet.
    This demonstrates many of the features of the code. It is readily
    modified and may be used to provide a framework for carrying out
    ACM calculations.

  acm1.4a-examples.pdf - A PDF file
    This is a PDF file created from the above Maple worksheet
    (using "export" and a bit of fiddling).
    It is about 162 pages long, and uses colour.
    It contains all the user input (in red), generated output
    (in blue) and comments (in black) from the worksheet.

  acm1.4-user.mpl - Maple code to set values and customise output.
    This file provides a framework for the user to specify various
    values that are used by the ACM code. In particular, it can be
    used to specify the location of the CG coefficients. It can also
    be used to change the default values that control the format of
    output from the ACM code.
    It is not necessary to use this file: indeed, it is not used by
    acm1.4-examples.mw whose Section 1 fulfils a similar purpose.
    However, it is very convenient when batch processing is used,
    or the user runs the code on different computers.

  so5cg-data13.zip  (4.3Mb)
  so5cg-data24.zip  (8.8Mb)
  so5cg-data56.zip  (21Mb)
    - archives that contain SO(5)>SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
          (v1,alpha1,L1,v2,alpha2,L2|v3,alpha3,L3).
    The first of these files contains coefficients for v2=1,3;
    the second for v2=2,4; the third for v2=5,6.
    For basic usage only the first is needed, while slightly more
    sophisticated usage requires the second, with the full range of
    ACM capabilities requiring the third.
    When unzipped, these zip files create directories
          v2=1/  v2=3/  v2=2/  v2=4/  v2=5/  v2=6/ 
    These should all be placed in a common directory, whose name
    must be specified when using the ACM code.
    (See Section 6.1 for more details).
    These data files contain all non-zero SO(5)>SO(3) CG coefficients
    for the following ranges:
       v2=1:   v1<v3<=50.
       v2=3:   v1<v3<=50.
       v2=2:   v1<=v3, v1<=30.
       v2=4:   v1<=v3, v1<=30.
       v2=5:   v1<=v3, v1<=25.
       v2=6:   v1<=v3, v1<=25.
    In future, once calculated, further coefficients will be posted
    on the website
