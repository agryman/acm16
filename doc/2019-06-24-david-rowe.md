I attach a few documents and the Maple code.  It may not be the latest but, if you think it worthwhile to look into it further, I can get Trevor Welsh, who developed it, to send you the latest version and answer any questions you might have about it  (trevviewelsh@yahoo.co.uk).

Essentially the code enables applications of an algebraic version of the Aage Bohr model of the rotational and a quadrupole vibrations of nuclei.

The Hilbert space of the model is that of a 5-dimensional harmonic oscillator; thus it is the representation of a Heisenberg algebra with five components of an angular momentum L=2 quadrupole tensor as its coordinates and a corresponding set of five momentum coordinates are the infinitesimal generators of deformation.

 An earlier model than ours exists which makes use of the chain of subgroups U(5) > U(3) > SO(3) but it was not very practical because its basis states are those of a spherical harmonic oscillator whereas the interesting rotational states of nuclei are strongly deformed. Our approach makes use of the subgroup chain U(5) > SU(1,1) x SO(5) > SO(3) and the fact that we make use of known SU(1,1) CG coefficients and a recently developed code for calculating SO(5) CG coefficients (attached)

A series of applications illustrating what the code could do was published in 2004 (attached).  (It received a best paper award.)  The code has since been improved and made more versatile by Trevor Welsh who was with me in Toronto as a Research Associate for a few years.  

The reason the code was written in Maple  was because I wrote the first version and Maple is the only computer language that I have used in the past 40-odd years (in fact you introduced me to the Mac and Maple).  The only person who is now making any use of the code is a former post-doc of mine (Gabriela Thiamova (now in France) who took home the Maple software when she left Toronto but she knows about as much about computing as I do.

Anyway, I am sure the above is more than enough background.  There are two reason that give a renewed interest in this model:  (i) experimental studies of nuclear collective properties continue to be analysed in terms of an adiabatic approximation to this model which treats its rotations and vibrations as adiabatically decoupled; thus the code provides an easy check on a calculation and its validity;  (ii) it will also be of fundamental use in making a connection  between the classical theory and our new many-nucleon theory.
