I want to get a copy of the article:

[RTR2004] "Spherical harmonics and basic coupling coefficients for the group SO(5) in an SO(3) basis", by D.J. Rowe, P.S. Turner and J. Repka, J. Math. Phys. 45 (2004) 2761-2784.

There is a PDF at the website:
https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.1763004

Spherical harmonics and basic coupling coefficients for the group SO(5) in an SO(3) basis
J. Math. Phys. 45, 2761 (2004); https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1763004

I created an account at aip.scitation.org using my Ryerson email.

Still have "No Access". Cannot download PDF.

Does Ryerson have institutional access?

I think David had a PDF of every article he wrote. Find them.

I found 6 PDF's: 
JMP 45 2761 Rowe-.. SO(5) CG coeffs.pdf
JMP 45 2761 Rowe/.. SO(5) CG coeffs.pdf
