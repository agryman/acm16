Enclosed is the paper requested.  The results obtained were with an early version of the Maple code that I wrote but about which I recall very little. The other two Maple codes, were early versions of Trevor’s code that I used to obtain the results shown in the 2009 paper that I already sent to you.

What is my objective?   Experimentalists continue to use the old Bohr-Mottelson model, which is an adiabatic approximation to the full ACM (algebraic collective model) which, in turn, is an algebraic extension (which I introduced and for which Trevor’s code was written) of the more phenomenological liquid-drop Bohr model (which was hardly, if ever, used in practice).

Thus, we are optimistic that with a readily available computer code, the ACM, which can easily handle the full ACM with a variety of Hamiltonians, including its adiabatic and other approximations, would become a generally used tool.  But, no doubt I am being overly optimistic.  That was our original hope but the use of Maple proved (I am assuming) to be the obstacle to this happening.

My guess is that the most widely used computer languages are C, fortran, and python (but really I am only guessing).  It would seem to make most sense, if we consulted the journal Comput. Phys. Commun.
and if, for example, they would want to publish a short note with the inclusion of the more useable code (I recall that, when we first submitted the code, they mentioned that the language would be a barrier to its usage, but at that point we were already committed).  I had no idea that Maple is now offering conversion possibilities.  It does seem like the way to go.

At a more fundamental level, I have been constructing over the years an algebraic many-nucleon theory of nuclear collective states.  Thus, at some time in the future, there will be a need to see the extent to which ACM results are compatible with the full many-nucleon quantum mechanics.

Let me know, if the attached is what you wanted.
