Hi Trevor

Its good that you are updating Arthur and me on the latest versions of the code.  I am very naive wrt computer use and the last time I used your code was with the ACM16 version for calculating the results in the 2009 Rowe-Welsh-Caprio paper.  

Since that time, I have been developing many-nucleon theories  which should relate to the ACM in a hydrodynamic limit.  The ACM code, however, should continue to be much simpler for experimentalists to analyse their data than all the model approximations to it for which they typically write simple Bohr-Mottelson type codes (i.e. adiabatic approximations to it).  

Cheers
David
