# acm16

## Algebraic Collective Model (ACM) Version 16

The goal of this project is to translate the ACM16 Maple source code into one or
more other freely available languages, e.g. Python, so that it can be used more widely
within the Nuclear Physics research community.

The ACM16 code was developed by David Rowe and Trevor Welsch.

See [Trevor Welsch's University of Toronto Home Page](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~rowe/taw/taw_home.html)
for references to the original Maple source code and papers.
