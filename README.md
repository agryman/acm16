## Algebraic Collective Model (ACM)

The goal of this project is to translate the ACM Maple source code into one or
more other freely available languages, e.g. Python, so that it can be used more widely
within the Nuclear Physics research community.

The ACM code was developed by David Rowe and Trevor Welsch.

See [Trevor Welsch's University of Toronto Home 
Page](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/site-archive/rowe/taw/taw_home.html)
for references to the original Maple source code and papers.

Several versions of the ACM have been developed over the years.
This repo was seeded with version 16 which is currently obsolete.

  I aligned the manuscript and code version numbers, and decided to start
  a new scheme at version 1.1. The version that was eventually published
  in CPC was version 1.4 .

The latest version is 1.4.
Instructions for downloading and installing the latest version of the code
